# urban-event-detection

*) This is the material for the urban detection study done at NYU ViDA Lab. The aims of the study are:
 i) Review the state of the art of anomaly detection on point space time data; outline the structure of the space-time anomaly detection problem
 ii) Implement two techniques on NYC taxi density datasets
 
 *) The two techniques implemented are:
 - SaTScan Space-Time Permutation Model, Kulldorff 2005
 - Telang et al. clustering method, 2014
 They were extended to fit our data and our objectives.
